# Using the Lookout for Vision models and migrating off Amazon Lookout for Vision

Check this notebook for a walkthrough on training classification or segmentation models on a Amazon SageMaker Jupyter notebook. This demo uses the sample cookie data included here to train on with the package available on Amazon Sagemaker Marketplace (Algorithms) and package up a model for use. The marketplace listing is free of charge and provides by the Science and Service teams for a migration path from Amazon Lookout For Vision.
